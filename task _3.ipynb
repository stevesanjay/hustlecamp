      "Please don't buy, I'm using a logitech G102 mouse and it feels like the mouse is on sand or something. Moving the mouse has become very difficult for me, because when the mouse skates touch the pad's surface, idk it resists to move smoothly as it should, where as it produces slight friction which makes it very difficult to use in day to day life, However the print quality is very nice but that's secondary. And I'm writing this review after 4-5 months of using it. Please stay away from this. buy a cheap mouse pad from local shop.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     1\n",
